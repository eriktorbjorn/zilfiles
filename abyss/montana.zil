inhale a mouthful of water. Instead you discover that you can breathe quite
normally.|

yourself approaching Deepcore. The lights stay with you until you surface
inside the MoonPool, and then they streak away back toward the trench.|
	Catfish grabs your hand and hoists you to firm ground as easily as if you
were a child. He helps you out of your dive suit and into dry clothes. He
says that he thinks that there is some kind of benevolent alien at the bottom
of the Trench, and that Lindsey's monitoring system shows she is still alive,
down near the bottom of the trench.|
