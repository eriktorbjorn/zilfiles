"	Coffey bends over the wiring codes, glancing up occasionally to make sure
you don't try to attack him.|
	Suddenly you notice a strange phenomenon in the MoonPool behind him. Some
water is slowly forming into a shining column and rising above the surrounding
surface. After a few moments, a sort of three-fingered hand forms at the end
of the column. As you stare at in fascination, it slowly, silently, creeps up
behind Coffey, who remains oblivious to its presence.||
 
	[GRAPHIC]||
 
	Suddenly the pseudopod reaches out and snatches the gun from Coffey. He
whips around in time to see the column disappear below the surface of the
water, carrying his gun with it.|
	Something inside Coffey seems to snap. He looks at you wildly and shouts,
\"I know you're behind this, Brigman. I don't know what you want from that
sub, but I'm gonna make sure you never see it again.\" He turns and runs from
the room.|
	You follow Coffey. When he reaches the compressor room, Coffey brandishes
a tool over the compressor. As he sees you enter, he thrusts the tool deep
into the workings of the machine. It screams to a halt with an ear-piercing
shriek. Coffey yells over the noise, \"Up yours, Brigman!\" and dashes out of
the cylinder.|
	He then runs into the compression chamber. Through the open door to the
compression chamber, you can see Coffey tugging at the hatch that leads up to
Cab Three. He is unable to open it because Lindsey has locked it from the
other side." CR
